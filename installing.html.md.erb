This topic explains how to install MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id="plan"></a>Plan your Deployment ##

MySQL for PCF supports deployment to multiple availability zones (AZs) on vSphere only. For other infrastructures, make sure to specify only one AZ.

To achieve best uptime, it is best to deploy a load balancer in front of the SQL Proxy nodes. Please see the note in the [proxy](#proxy) section below. When configuring this load balancer, increase the minimum idle timeout if possible, as many load balancers are tuned for short-lived connections unsuitable for long-running database queries. See the [known issue](known-issues.html#load-balancer-timeout) for more details.

Provided below is a table for those that deploy the MySQL service on a different network than Elastic Runtime. Refer to this table to configure any firewall rules to allow inbound and outbound traffic required by the MySQL service.

| Type | Listening service | TCP Port |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Inbound/TCP | Service broker | 8081 |
| Inbound/TCP | SQL proxy | 3306 |
| Inbound/TCP | Proxy health check | 1936 |
| Inbound/TCP | Proxy API | 8080 |
| Inbound/TCP | Proxy health check | 1936 |
| Outbound/TCP | NATS | 4222 |
| Internal/TCP | MySQL server | 3306 |
| Internal/TCP | Galera | 4567 |
| Internal/TCP | Galera health check | 9200 |

## <a id="load-balancer"></a> Configure a Load Balancer

In older versions of the product, applications were given the IP of the single MySQL server in bind credentials. When upgrading to v1.5.0, existing applications will continue to function, but, to take advantage of high availability features, they must be rebound to receive either the IP of the first proxy instance or the IP/hostname of a load balancer.

In order to configure a load balancer with the IPs of the proxy tier before v1.5.0 is deployed and prevent applications from obtaining the IP of the first proxy instance, the product enables an operator to configure the IPs that will be assigned to proxy instances. The following instructions applies to the **Proxy** settings page for the MySQL product in Operation Manager.

- In the **Proxy IPs** field, enter a list of IP addresses that should be assigned to the proxy instances. These IP addresses must be in the CIDR range configured in the Director tile and not be currently allocated to another VM. Look at the **Status** pages of other tiles to see what IP addresses are in use.

- In the **Binding Credentials Hostname** field, enter the hostname or IP address that should be given to bound applications for connecting to databases managed by the service. This hostname or IP address should resolve to your load balancer and be considered long-lived. When this field is modified, applications must be rebound to receive updated credentials.

Recommendations for configuring your load balancer:

* **Configure your load balancer in failover-only mode.** As proxy instances are not synchronized, we recommend configuring your load balancer to send all traffic to one proxy instance at a time until it fails, then failover to another proxy instance. This is not possible on Amazon ELB.

* **Make your idle time out long enough to not interrupt long-running queries.** Long-running queries can be interrupted by load balancer timeout. A connection that is waiting for results will appear to some load balancers as an idle connection. These long-running queries may be interrupted if they exceed the load balancer's idle timeout.  
For example, [AWS's Elastic Load Balancer](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/config-idle-timeout.html) has a default idle timeout of 60 seconds, so if a query takes longer than this duration then the MySQL connection will be severed and an error will be returned.

* **To configure your load balancer with a healthcheck or monitor, use TCP against port 1936.**. Unauthenticated healthchecks against port 3306 will cause the service to become unavailable, and will require manual intervention to fix.

#### <a id="proxy-sync"></a> Proxies may write to different MySQL masters

All proxy instances use the same method to determine cluster health. However, certain conditions may cause the proxy instances to route to different nodes, for example after brief cluster node failures.

This could be an issue for tables that receive many concurrent writes. Multiple clients writing to the same table could obtain locks on the same row, resulting in a deadlock. One commit will succeed and all others will fail and must be retried. This can be prevented by configuring your load balancer to route connections to **only one proxy instance at a time**.


#### <a id="add-lb"></a> Adding a Load Balancer after an Initial Deploy

If v1.5.0 is initially deployed without a load balancer and without proxy IPs configured, a load balancer can be setup later to remove the proxy as a single point of failure. However, there are several implications to consider:

- Applications will have to be rebound to receive the hostname or IP that resolves to the load balancer. To rebind: unbind your application from the service instance, bind it again, then restage your application. For more information see [Managing Service Instances with the CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html). In order to avoid unnecessary rebinding, we recommend configuring a load balancer before deploying v1.5.0.
- Instead of configuring the proxy IPs in Operations manager, use the IPs that were dynamically assigned by looking at the **Status** page. Configuration of proxy IPs after the product is deployed with dynamically assigned IPs is not well supported; see [Known Issues](#known-issues).

## <a id="asg"></a> Create an Application Security Group

Create an [Application Security Group](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) (ASG) for MySQL for PCF. See [Creating Application Security Groups for MySQL](./app-security-groups.html) for instructions.

The ASG allows smoke tests to run when you install the MySQL for PCF service, and allows apps to access the service once it is installed.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The service will not be installable or usable until an ASG is in place.</p>
